# Low Level Design

Real-world design pattern implementations in Java — because good architecture isn't just theory.

## Implementations

| Pattern | Problem | Key Concepts |
|---------|---------|--------------|
| [Strategy](./StrategyPattern) | Duck Simulation | Composition over inheritance, runtime behavior swapping |
| [Observer](./ObserverPattern) | Weather Station | Loose coupling, pub-sub, one-to-many relationships |
| ... | *More coming* | |
