# Low Level Design

Real-world design pattern implementations in Java — because good architecture isn't just theory.

## Implementations

| Pattern | Problem | Key Concepts |
|---------|---------|--------------|
| [Strategy](./Patterns/StrategyPattern) | Duck Simulation | Composition over inheritance, runtime behavior swapping |
| [Observer](./Patterns/ObserverPattern) | Weather Station | Loose coupling, pub-sub, one-to-many relationships |
| [Decorator](./Patterns/DecoratorPattern) | Coffee Shop | Open-closed principle, dynamic behavior extension |
| [Factory](./Patterns/FactoryPattern) | Pizza Shop | Dependency Inversion principle, dynamic object creation |
| [Singleton](./Patterns/SingletonPattern) | Chocolate Factory | Thread safe singleton, java enum singleton |
| [Command](./Patterns/CommandPattern) | Remote with undo | Loosely coupled, Open Close principle |
